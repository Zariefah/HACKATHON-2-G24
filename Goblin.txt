To become a great player, a player must successfully complete each level. A young candidates soldier is faced with a crucial test to demonstrate their mettle in order to complete Level 1 of their training, which involves navigating the maze-like corridors inhabited by a lone goblin named Snik.

In light of this sobering fact, the player must decide fast whether to engage the goblin in combat, use their skills, or flee the dangerous situation.
