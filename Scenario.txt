It was a long day. You step onto the subway after a long and tiring day at work. The weariness weighs heavily on you as you find a seat and try to fight off the urge to doze off. The rhythmic swaying of the train and the monotonous hum of the tracks lull you into a drowsy state, your eyelids becoming heavy.


Suddenly, the subway comes to an abrupt halt, jolting you awake. 


TAP! TAP! TAP!


The loud, metallic sound startles you, and you quickly look around, sensing a change in the atmosphere. Confusion fills the subway car as your fellow passengers exchange bewildered glances, their expressions mirroring your own.


Before anyone can fully comprehend what's happening, a monstrous creature bursts into the subway car, its snarling fangs and menacing claws instilling fear in your heart. You find yourself frozen in shock, your mind racing to grasp the reality of the situation.


But then, a figure emerges from the shadows, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. A strong and muscular soldier steps forward, exuding confidence and bravery. Relief floods over you as you witness the soldier's unwavering determination to protect everyone.


Without hesitation, the soldier launches a powerful punch, striking the creature with remarkable strength. The subway car erupts into cheers and applause as the soldier valiantly fights against the monstrous threat, saving you and the rest of the passengers from imminent danger.


As the battle unfolds, you can't help but feel a surge of admiration for the soldier's heroic actions. Encouraged by their bravery, you and the other passengers find your courage and join the fight, doing whatever you can to aid the soldier in defeating the creature.


Finally, with a deafening roar, the creature falls defeated to the ground, its threat neutralized. The subway car becomes filled with a mix of relief, gratitude, and awe for the soldier's valor.


Stepping outside the subway, you gaze upon a world in ruins, devastated by an apocalyptic event. Buildings crumble, and a sense of desolation hangs heavy in the air. It's a grim sight that confronts you and the rest of the survivors.


Out of thin air, a shimmering window materializes right in front of you, its edges outlined with a faint, ethereal glow.
