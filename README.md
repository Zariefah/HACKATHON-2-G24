## TITLE: Monster Chaos:The Final Apocalypse


### DESCRIPTION

A text-based game, also known as a text adventure or interactive fiction, is a type of game that relies primarily on textual descriptions and user input. In a text-based game, the player interacts with the game world and progresses through the story by reading descriptive text and typing commands to perform actions.

  "Monster Chaos: The Final Apocalypse!" is an enticing role-playing game that transports players on an exciting expedition through a lively and enchanting fantasy realm. In this immersive journey, players take on the role of a brave hero, embarking on a quest to become formidable warriors by conquering the mighty Great Creature. Along the way, they encounter a diverse range of monsters, engage in strategic battles, and unravel the secrets of this magical world.

  In "Monster Chaos: The Final Apocalypse!" Players have the power to determine the outcome of their journey. By defeating the Great Creature, they demonstrate their prowess as aspiring soldiers. To achieve this feat, the player is given a role: priest, warrior, or mage that will be randomly determined by the game.
As a mage with the power of black magic, you possess the ability to unleash dark and fearsome forces that can intimidate and weaken monsters. When you employ your black magic, the monster's health will decrease by 10.in addition he also possess the power of illusionist’s mirage that create illusion to confuse the monster and make them difficult to attack.with this power ,monster health will decrease by 12. A mage  with ability to cast powerful hex on the monster to make their life draining called Necrotic Hex.It will decrease the monster health by 9.

  If player randomly get the role as a priest in the game, they have a special move called "Healing Touch." When you use it, you can heal yourself by channelling divine energy and regain 10 health points, allowing you to stay strong during your adventures. In addition, you possess the power of "Divine Smite," where you can call upon divine forces to unleash holy power on the monster you're facing. This attack decreases the monster's health by 15 points, weakening it. If the monster's health reaches zero or less, you achieve victory. Lastly, as a priest, you have the "Blessing of the Stars" ability, which emits radiant light and temporarily blinds the monster. This move decreases the monster's health by 20 points, making it easier for you to defeat. If the monster's health reaches zero or goes below, it is defeated. 
Imagine you're a brave warrior with a strong sword and a sturdy shield in an exciting adventure. When you attack the monster, you swing your sword really hard, making it lose 10 points of health and become weaker. Then, you use your shield to hit the monster forcefully, stunning it and causing it to lose 15 points of health. Finally, you let out a powerful warcry that scares the monster and reduces its health by 12. By using these moves, you can defeat the monster and become even stronger in your journey.
In this game, players have the exciting opportunity to not only defeat fearsome monsters but also earn valuable rewards in the form of gold. As players engage in intense battles and emerge victorious against great enemies, they will be rewarded with gold based on their achievements. This gold serves as a currency within the game, allowing players to unlock a wide range of items to enhance their gameplay experience.

  With the gold they accumulate, players can visit the in-game marketplace and explore a vast selection of items, including powerful weapons, protective armour, and healing pills. These items can significantly bolster a player's combat abilities, increase their defence, or restore their health during challenging encounters. Players can view the item purchased on the inventory space and use it when needed. 

  Each item has its own capabilities to defeat the terrifying monster. “Venom Stick” can cause damage to the monster at 15 health. The monster will feel sickened by the venomous substance in the Venom Stick. If the player proceeds to use “Elixir of Invisibility”, the monsters are unable to see the player and allow the player to freely attack the opponents. This item also enables the player to beat the monster at 17 health points. Next, the “Scroll of Fireball” can burn the monster in the fire and decrease the monster's health by 16 health points. We also provide a health potion which is “Red Pill” to help players to increase their health by 50 points. After using the item during the battle, the item used will be removed from the player's inventory space.
 
  Victory in "Monster Chaos: The Final Apocalypse!" requires more than just brute strength. Players must employ cunning strategies, ensuring they manage their health effectively. If their health reaches zero, the game ends. Therefore, players must strike a balance between offensive and defensive tactics, make wise decisions to survive the encounter and emerge victorious. With engaging gameplay and a captivating storyline, "Monster Chaos: The Final Apocalypse!" promises an entertaining adventure filled with excitement, character development, and tactical challenges.

### HOW OBJECT-ORIENTED CONCEPTS WERE USED IN THIS GAME

In the "Monster Chaos: The Final Apocalypse!" game, several object-oriented concepts are utilised to structure the code and manage the game's functionality. Here's how these concepts are applied:
 

1. Classes are the essential building blocks of object-oriented programming in the game "Monster Chaos: The Final Apocalypse!" A variety of classes are used to represent game features, like items, nodes, Inventory, monsters, players, and games. For example, the Node class represents a node in a linked list and has properties such as "item" and "next," as well as a constructor method (init) to initialise node objects. The Item class is in charge of storing item names and returning them as necessary. The Monster class holds information on the name, level, and health status of a monster. Furthermore, the Player class uses composition by incorporating an instance of the Inventory class to manage player data, status, and save player progress in a text file. For the game class, it stores the player status that the player keyed in in the player class and prints all scenarios.
2. The classes Item, Node, Inventory, Monster, Player, and Game all have member variables and member functions declared with different access modifiers (private, public). This helps in encapsulating the internal implementation details of the class and controlling access to its members.
3. Object: Objects are instances of classes, and they were created to represent specific instances of items, nodes, inventories, monsters, and players. In this game code,we create game objects to successfully run our code.

 
These object-oriented concepts help organise the code, promote reusability, and provide a clear structure to the game’s function.



### How Linked lists play a role in our game.

A linked list plays a crucial role in managing the players inventory in our coding. Here's how it works:

1. Adding an item: When the player purchases a new item, the addItem function is called. This function creates a new Node object with the item's information and inserts it into the linked list. If the list is empty, the new node becomes the head of the list. Otherwise, the new node is inserted at the end of the list by traversing through the existing nodes using the next pointers.

 

2. Removing an item: When the player sells or discards an item, the removeItem function is called. This function searches for the node containing the item to be removed by traversing through the linked list. Once found, the function adjusts the next pointers of the previous and next nodes to bypass the node to be removed, effectively removing it from the list.

 

3. Retrieving an item: The getItem function allows the player to search for a specific item in the inventory. It traverses the linked list, comparing the item's information with each node's item. If a match is found, the function returns a pointer to the node containing the item. Otherwise, it returns a null pointer, indicating that the item is not present in the inventory.

 

4. Displaying the items: The displayItems function is responsible for printing the details of all the items in the inventory. It traverses through the linked list, starting from the head node, and prints the information for each item.

 
By using a linked list, players can dynamically add and remove items from the inventory without the need to allocate a fixed-size array. The linked list allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations, making it suitable for managing a dynamic collection of items.
